                        which are technically part of the pancake family."</li>
                    <li>"Waffles have about 100 calories than pancakes, and more cholesterol too."</li> 
                    <li>"Pancakes are way older than waffles; they’ve been around in some form since 
                        at least the 1430s."</li>
                    <li>"If you have a squeeze bottle and a knack for it, you can make pancakes in 
                        literally any shape."</li>

                    <li>"Both plain pancakes and waffles are lightly sweet and a little bready, although 
                        waffles are more so on both counts; they generally have more butter and sugar in the 
                        batter and become more caramelized during cooking, so they taste a little richer."</li> 
                    <li>"Waffles trap syrup (or whatever else you want to top them with) in all their 
                        handy nooks and crannies while staying crisp for a relatively long while."</li>
                    <li>"Waffles make better sandwiches than pancakes do."</li>
